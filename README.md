# Overview

I wrote two different programs in Rust to get more practice. The other program is stored in a seperate repository. I wrote a fibonacci sequence program. This program
uses a function to establish the fibonacci sequence. Once a number is passed in it will return that number in the fibonacci sequence.

# Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code to develope these programs. I downloaded rust using rustup. Rustup will download all the necessary tool to code in the Rust langauge. For this program 
I didn't use any additional libraries.

# Future Work

- Allow the user to enter their own number.
- Use the returned value in some other form or equation of some sort.
- Allow the user to store the numbers they enter and the result.
